# Final Project Updates & Competition Briefing 🏆🏦

Below is a summary of the high-impact "Killer Features" and technical upgrades implemented in CareBank AI. Use this list to impress the judges!

### **1. 🧠 Multi-Agent AI Orchestration**
*   **The Upgrade**: Beyond simple tracking, we now use a tiered agent architecture.
*   **Key Agents**: Tax Agent, Risk Agent, Savings Agent, and the new **Fraud Detection Agent**.
*   **Impact**: Proactive advice that feels human, not robotic.

### **2. 🛡️ Forensic "Command Center" (Banker View)**
*   **The Upgrade**: A high-fidelity tabbed interface for bank managers.
*   **Forensic Tools**: Real-time "Benford's Law" analysis, Duplicate Detectors, and Round-Number Bias checks to ensure data integrity.
*   **Visuals**: Includes Area & Bar charts using Recharts for deep cashflow auditing.

### **3. 📈 "What-If" Financial Simulator**
*   **The Upgrade**: Added predictive AI capabilities.
*   **Impact**: Users can input hypothetical purchases (e.g., a "Car" or "Laptop") and see a projected leap/dip in their Financial Health Score *before* they spend.

### **4. 📄 Robust "Any-Format" Data Ingestion**
*   **The Upgrade**: Implemented a **Dual-Pass PDF Extractor**.
*   **Capability**: If a PDF bank statement has a messy layout, the AI falls back to **Regex OCR** to find transactions. It also maps custom CSV headers (e.g., "Narrative" vs "Description") automatically.

### **5. 🔔 AI Notification Suite**
*   **The Upgrade**: A real-time, fixed-position notification center in the sidebar.
*   **Intelligence**: Agents push proactive alerts for budget overruns, security flags, or tax-saving opportunities.

### **6. 🔐 Hardened Security Infrastructure**
*   **Measures**: JWT Tokenization, CORS strict-origin protection, and custom Rate Limiting to prevent brute-force data faking.
*   **Privacy**: Local LLM (Ollama) fallbacks to keep sensitive financial data on the edge when needed.
